           <h1>Laura and Deanna Fanning</h1>
           <p>Laura and Deanna Fanning are twins who grew up in Australian suburbs and moved to London by 2016 where 
            they enrolled in Central Saint Martinâ€™s renowned MA fashion course together. They then had the opportunity to 
            launch the womenswear line of Kiko Kostandinov by already having a personal and professional relationship with 
            Kiko himself, having assisted the menswear designer as a student. The womenswear line of Kiko Kostandinov 
            launched in 2018 where they featured striking knits, innovative cuts of garments, and vivid prints throughout. 
            They design distinctively from the menswear line, putting original spins on traditional styles and modernizing 
            tailored pieces such as their trousers with star shaped stitching at the knees and spliced seams. 
        </p>
        <p>Through the line they offer everything a woman would seek for everyday life from outerwear to t-shirts to trousers, 
            even offering an extensive line of shoes done in collaboration with Asics. The line is well-known for the colorful 
            approach to their designs and the various prints that mix and match together creating their distinct aesthetic. 
        </p>
        <p>The twins have backgrounds in the humanities (philosophy, psychology, and anthropology) which informs how they design, 
            approaching collections with a social and political awareness of womenswear history and the role womenswear plays today. 
            Laura saying her previous humanities experience makes you stop and think a bit more about what clothes mena and how they 
            communicate yourself as a being.
