            <h1>Rei Kawakubo</h1>
            <p>Rei Kawakubo is the founder of the Comme des Garcons label and Dover Street Market. She is a Japanese fashion designer based in Tokyo and Paris. 
                Kawakubo did not get formal fashion design training in school and instead attended Keio University in Japan where she studied fine arts and literature. 
                After graduating, Kawakubo worked in advertising for a textile company for three years and then became a freelance stylist. 
                After two years, she began designing and making her own clothes under the name Comme des Garcons, meaning “like the boys” in french, and fully incorporated the label in 1973. 
                Kawakubo opened her first Tokyo boutique in 1975 and also added a menswear line “Comme des Garcons Homme” in 1978. 
            </p>
            <p>In 1981, Kawakubo presented her first collection at Paris fashion Week and is noted to be one of the main forces in bringing Japanese fashion to the West. 
                Other designers noted alongside her include Yohji Yamamoto, who also showed in Paris Fashion Week that year. Kawakubo and Yamamoto dated in the 1980’s-90’s 
                and are said to have influenced each other's fashion at the time, as they have similar aesthetics and design codes.
            </p>
            <p>Being from a non-technical background, Kawakubo’s design process also follows an unconventional flow that she is revered for. 
                In an email when asked about her process, she said
            </p>
            <p class="email">My design process never starts or finishes. I am always hoping to find something through the mere act of living my daily life. 
                I do not work from a desk, and do not have an exact starting point for any collection. There is never a mood board, I do not go through fabric swatches, 
                I do not sketch, there is no eureka moment, there is no end to the search for something new. As I live my normal life, 
                I hope to find something that click starts a thought, and then something totally unrelated would arise, and then maybe a third unconnected element would come from nowhere. 
                Often in each collection, there are three or so seeds of things that come together accidentally to form what appears to everyone else as a final product, but for me it is never ending. 
                There is never a moment when I think, ‘this is working, this is clear.’ If for one second I think something is finished, the next thing would be impossible to do.
            </p>
