            <h1>Olivier Theyskens</h1>
            <p>Olivier Theyskens is a Belgian fashion designer and is now the owner and designer of his namesake brand. 
                He went to École Nationale Supérieure des Arts Visuels de la Cambre in Brussels to study Fashion Design 
                in 1994 and in 1997 he dropped out to start his own label. One of the biggest catalysts of Theyskens’ 
                career was Madonna wearing one of his pieces to the Academy Awards in 1998. Andre Leon Talley, one of 
                the most respected fashion journalists and was editor-at-large at Vogue Magazine, listed this dress as 
                one of his personal favorite oscar dresses of all time in a 2015 article for Vogue. Theyskens’ then presented 
                his first full collection in Paris in 1998 and his Spring 1999 collection was featured on Vogue in the 25 
                most unforgettable runway shows of the 90’s. In the year 2000, Theyskens’ was said to be one of the most 
                powerful and creative personalities in fashion via Vogue and won the Venus de la Mode award. Theyskens’ 
                continued to work on his line under his own name until 2002 when he then transitioned to the creative 
                director of Rochas, one of the oldest fashion houses in Paris.
            </p>
            <p>Under Rochas, Theyskens’ designed costumes in 2003 for the National Opera House of Belgium, Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie. 
                Theyskens’  also received the Star Award from the Fashion Group International in 2005. In 2006, Rochas’ fashion line had 
                been discontinued due to it being the only fashion line under the parent company Procter & Gamble and they did not have 
                sufficient resources or skills to continue it. 
            </p>
            <p>Olivier Theyskens then moved to Nina Ricci where he was appointed the artistic director and changed his focus to 
                designing a younger, more casual audience. His designs for the Nina Ricci brand were also met with acclaim and praise. 
                Theyskens’ was artistic director for three years and left the Nina Ricci brand in 2009. Theyskens then moved to Theory 
                in 2010 and was the artistic director for another four years. He then left the brand in 2014 to pursue various design projects. 
            </p>
            <p>In 2016, Theyskens’ went back to designing under his own namesake label and released his first collection since 2002. His return to his 
                namesake label was entirely self-funded and sought Maximiliano Nicolelli, who worked for LVMH and La Perla, as his Chief Executive. 
                Theyskens’ has since been designing under his own name and has been the acting artistic director of Azzaro since 2020.
