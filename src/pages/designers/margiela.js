            <h1>Martin Margiela</h1>
            <p>Martin Margiela is a Belgian fashion designer who founded the French label Maison Margiela. 
                Margiela has become one of the most iconic designers in recent fashion due to his specific upcycled 
                aesthetic and deconstructed silhouettes. Despite being one of the biggest names in fashion, Margiela 
                has never done a face-to-face interview or photograph in order to keep the focus of his brand on the 
                clothes and designs themselves. Margiela graduated from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp Belgium 
                in 1979 and is famously part of the fashion collective “Antwerp Six”, known for their collective Avant-Garde 
                innovative brands. 
            </p>
            <p>Before starting his brand, Margiela worked as a freelance designer for five years and then became a design 
                assistant to Jean Paul Gaultier in Paris until 1987. In 1988, Margiela then created his own label, 
                Maison Martin Margiela, with a small team of only two other people to help start up the label. Margiela’s 
                first shows distinguished himself from all other designers of the time. Margiela showed his collections at 
                various unconventional locations on the outskirts of Paris away from the 1st arrondissement where fashion 
                shows had almost exclusively taken place in. His first show was in an old Cafe where models walked through 
                the very dark cafe with the Velvet Underground’s “Guess I’m Falling in Love” blaring throughout the space. 
                This distinctly different setting for his shows continued throughout his career with one of his most famous 
                shows taking place in 1989. Margiela had his show take place on a playground in a North African neighborhood 
                on the outside of Paris. In use of the kid’s playground, Margiela asked them to also hand draw all the invites and 
                invited the children to sit in the front row of the show and some even walking with and being carried by the models. 
                This was one of the most famous shows in modern fashion history for the democratizing effect it held at a time 
                when fashion was revered for its exclusivity. 
            </p>
            <p>Margiela continued his career until 2009 where he focused on designing in an upcycling manner. Famously, he created 
                a guide for people to follow that taught them to sew their own sweater out of old socks. Many of his designs take 
                a deconstructed approach as well by exposing the seams of garments and using different pieces of various found 
                garments such as turning a single leather glove into a purse and even making a waistcoat out of old broken fine porcelain plates. 
            </p>
            <p>After leaving the eponymous brand in 2009, Margiela did not actively work in the fashion industry anymore and has kept a low 
                profile since then. In 2019, Margiela helped to produce a documentary outlining his early career and his time at the brand. 
                In 2021, Margiela also debuted an art exhibition at the Lafayette Anticipations in Paris featuring over 20 different large-scale 
                sculpture works. The Maison Margiela brand has continued though being ran by his atelier team following his leaving of the brand 
                until John Galliano was appointed the creative director in 2014.
